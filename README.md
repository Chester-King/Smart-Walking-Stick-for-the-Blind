# Smart-Walking-Stick-for-the-Blind
Use of ultrasonic sonic sensors to alert the user of obstacles.

# Dectecting obstacles using ultrasonic sensors
We are using two ultrasonic sensors at an angle of 75 degrees from either side of the line of path. Each of the sensors can detect the obstacle at a range of 70 centimeters. A buzzer is placed on the stick which will produce three different sounds for obsectels for all three direction(Left,Centre and Right).

# INSTALLATION
You need an Arduino(Uno) board, two Ultrasonic Sensors, a buzzer, a breadboard and a walking stick.

# NOTE
The program was designed and verified on Arduino(1.8.5) and was tested on the Arduino(UNO) board. It was then implemented on the walking stick. The images of the stick has also been uploaded

# RUN
After using the stick it gave the desired sound for obstacle on each side.
